Open-source template for a Best-Practice Pledge, for data-driven coordinated avoidance of system-collapse.


## Coordination For Best Practice

Nonpartisan policy and data coordination between local executives and administrations can be a cost effective way of:
- preventing and managing problems and liabilities and 
- facilitating measurable progress

A flexible framework or template can be supportive. For example
a starting place is a basic, noninvasive, and non-controversial level of acknowledging the importance of specific questions. Later can follow deeper levels of exchanging information and coordinating behaviors.

A basic best-practice pledge (consistent with being restricted to recognizing questions) could have four sections:

## 1. A Values Statements Section: 
- regarding participation in society and best practice principles:
operationally defined: participation-items, setting-location items, definition-behavior items, contact-proximity items, and standard agreement items. 
- a goal here is establishing compromise-friendly areas where agreements can be aligned, for example areas of agreed upon importance regardless of specific implementation details being different separate time/places/institutions. 

## 2. A Clarification Statements Section: 
- clarifying historically unaffirmed (neglected) constructive values
- clarifying historically unchallenged problems
- clearly anticipating predictable obstructions

## 3. A Standard Error Report Section:
- for auditing frequent areas of process failure

## 4. A Macro-Models Section:
- important areas for agreements and audits
