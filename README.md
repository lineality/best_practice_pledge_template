Open-source template for a Best-Practice Pledge, for data-driven coordinated avoidance of system-collapse.


## Coordination For Best Practice

Nonpartisan policy and data coordination between local executives and administrations can be a cost effective way of preventing and managing problems and liabilities and of facilitating measurable progress. 

From a basic, noninvasive and non-controversial level of acknowledging the importance of specific questions, through to deeper levels of exchanging information and coordinating behaviors, a flexible framework or template can be supportive:

A basic pledge (consistent with being restricted to recognizing questions) could have four sections:
## 1. A Values Statement Section: 
- regarding operationally defined participation in society and best practice principles

## 2. A Clarification Statements Section: 
- heading off policy predictably contentious topics and obstacles

## 3. A Standard Error Report Section:
- regarding frequent areas of failure for process audits

## 4. A Macro Models Section:
- Regarding overall policy and process areas of significance
