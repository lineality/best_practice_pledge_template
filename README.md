## Coordination For Best Practice

Nonpartisan policy and data coordination between local executives and administrations can be a cost effective way of preventing and managing problems and liabilities and of facilitating measurable progress. 

From a basic, noninvasive and non-controversial level of acknowledging the importance of specific questions, through to deeper levels of exchanging information and coordinating behaviors, a flexible framework or template can be supportive:

A basic pledge (consistent with being restricted to recognizing questions) could have four sections:
## 1. A Values Statement Section: 
- regarding participation in society and best practice principles:
operationally defined: participation-items, setting-location items, definition-behavior items, contact-proximity items, and standard agreement items. 

## 2. A Clarification Statements Section: 
- heading off policy predictably contentious topics and obstacles:
- Clarifying historically unchallenged problems.
- Clarifying historically unaffirmed (neglected) constructive values. 


## 3. A Standard Error Report Section:
- for auditing frequent areas of process failure

## 4. A Macro Models Section:
- Regarding overall policy and process areas of significance
